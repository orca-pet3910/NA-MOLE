# MOLE v2.0
welcome to MOLE, a programming language project!
## how to install
you need a version of Python 3 compatible with the following packages:
- shlex with shlex.split()
- time with time.sleep()
- random with random.randint()
a recommended version of Python is Python 3.12.2
## how to use
the syntax for the command is
`python mole.py filename.mole`
a .mole file extension is unnecessary
you should read the help sheet too by making a file with nothing but `help` in it and running it with mole.py
