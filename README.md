welcome to MOLE, a programming language project!
## dependencies
- `__random__`
- `__shell__`
- `__statements__`
- `random`
- `shlex`
- `time`
- `sys`

## how to install
you need a version of Python 3 compatible with the following packages:
- shlex with shlex.split()
- time with time.sleep()
- random with random.randint()
- 
a recommended version of Python is Python 3.12.2
## how to use
the syntax for the command is
`python mole.py filename.mole [-p/-s] [--nologo/--pause-on-exit]`

a .mole file extension is **unnecessary** too

you should read the help sheet too by making a file with nothing but `help` in it and running it with mole.py
